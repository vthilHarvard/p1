                <h3 class="text-info">Who Am I?</h3>
                <p>I'm from India originally. I have a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering.
                <br />I've lived and worked in New Hampshire for many years. My husband PT and I have 2 kids and a pet goldfish.</p>
                <p>Spring through Fall are seasons that I enjoy- but winter ... lets just say its very pretty!</p>
                <h3 class="text-info">Why am I taking this course?</h3>
                <p>I was on a Mommy track for a while- but would love to work at a company soon or start my own web based consulting business</p>
                <p>I'm trying to get a Web Technology Certificate from the Harvard Extension school</p>
                <p>I also teach introductory programming in C#, VB at a local community college</p>
                <h3 class="text-info">My programming background</h3>
                <p>I worked for a startup which got bought by Parametric Technology Corporation in Neehdam MA.<br />
                We developed a product for Electronic Design Automation, creating code for design comparisons and metrics of multi-layer Printed Circuit Boards(PCBs).
                <br />I have worked with Microsoft Viusal Studio, C++ and then some Java, XML for more than 10 years</p>
                <h3 class="text-info">The platform that I currently use</h3>
                <p>Windows 8 computer currently. I have a Windows 7 desktop, which had some issues with SSH. So, in the interest of time, I switched to Windows 8</p>
                <p>I'll be checking on the Windows 7 issue as soon as I submit this P1 project</p>
                <h3 class="text-info">Anything else from me</h3>
                <p>I feel like I have learnt quite a bit about working with git, live servers just within this first week</p>
                <p>I look forward to doing more and practicing enough to build a 'muscle memory' of all things PHP in the upcoming weeks</p>
